    <h2>[Summary]</h2>
    <p>
      The Gaming Room is a game development team focused on the Android platform. They want to take their successful game, "Draw It or Lost It", and bring it to other operating platforms. The goal is to have a web-based application that can be consumed on multiple platforms, thus expanding their user base.

    <h3>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</h3>
    <p>
       The strongest points in my documentation are the recommendations surrounding operating platform and software stack. In particular, my experience in systems administration has given me a good perspective on what would need to be done to select a cost-effective, efficient, and reliable platform for securely hosting the application and its user data.

    <h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>
    <p>
       The biggest benefit that I took away from this process, and by far the most helpful to me, is how oriented I felt in the project after working through the design document. In earlier classes, I found myself writing code first and then going back to implement requirements after the fact. This process has taught me that by first writing down your thoughts, and then formalizing them in a standardized way, project requirements and goals can be clearly conveyed to the point that writing the code comes with less friction. The larger the code base, the more beneficial this would be.

    <h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>
    <p>
      If I could go back and revise one part of this, it would be the module 3 submission, which included the "Executive Summary", "Design Constraints", and "System Architecture View" sections. After taking the instructor's feedback into consideration, I re-read this section. I did not go into enough detail on the system requirements, focusing too much on design constraints. The summary, while sufficiently brief, could have used a couple of additional sentences to expand upon the requirements. While it is only a summary, more information could have been conveyed while remaining concise.

    <h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3>
    <p>
      I based this design document on the user's needs and not on my personal preferences. An example of this would be recommending the Mac OS operating platform for a development environment. A review of the client's experiences and constraints signaled that this would be the path with the least friction to develop while continuing to leverage their existing experiences. It is important to consider the user's needs first because there is no project or work without the user. If the user's needs are not met, there would not be any reason to continue working with the consultant. To further that point, the user's needs must be fully understood so that the desired outcome is actually achieved.
    </p>
    <h3>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</h3>
    <p>
      I approached the designing phase with a focus on the requirements communicated by the user. Keywords were used as clues to provide direction during the process. For example, the client indicated that they did not know how to setup an environment to develop a web-based application, but that they had Android development experience. This information was used to recommend not only the operating platform for development, but also the software stack to be used for the application. The software was designed iteratively. Each piece was built upon the one before it, over the span of several assignments. In the future, I would spend more time concisely laying out a more well-defined set of constraints and requirements. There were several pieces of information left out of the document that would have been helpful, if not required, in practice.
